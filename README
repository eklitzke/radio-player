The intention is that this will be a small program that lets you listen to
Internet radio using the GHC gstreamer bindings.

My plan is to try to get KALX working first, since it's not multipart (and
therefore should be easier), and then to see if I can get it to support SomaFM
(which ough to be considerably more complex).

This is just for fun/learning.

Current Status
==============
The GStreamer bindings are almost totally undocumented, but there was a demo
program in the Gtk2Hs darcs tree, and with that I've gotten a really crude
player up and running (yes, it plays audio!). Currently the radio program will
write to a named pipe "/tmp/radio.fifo" in a forkIO, and the GStreamer code
will read from this pipe.

This is kind of ugly. Try as I might, I wasn't able to figure out how to get
the radio player to work without a temporary file. GStreamer has a mode where
it can read from a file descriptor, but what would always happen is it would
play for a few seconds and then stop. My suspicion is that these first few
seconds were the buffered content, and GStreamer didn't know how to make the
socket fetch more data.

I hope to get something working without temporary files...
