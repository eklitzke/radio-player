The intention is that this will be a small program that lets you listen to
Internet radio using the GHC gstreamer bindings.

My plan is to try to get KALX working first, since it's not multipart (and
therefore should be easier), and then to see if I can get it to support SomaFM
(which ough to be considerably more complex).

This is just for fun/learning.
