The intention is that this will be a small program that lets you listen to
Internet radio using the GHC gstreamer bindings.

My plan is to try to get KALX working first, since it's not multipart (and
therefore should be easier), and then to see if I can get it to support SomaFM
(which ough to be considerably more complex).

This is just for fun/learning.

Current Status
==============
The GStreamer bindings are almost totally undocumented, but there was a demo
program in the Gtk2Hs darcs tree, and with that I've gotten a really crude
player up and running (yes, it plays audio!). Currently one program reads from
KALX and writes to a fifo, and the other program reads from the fifo and plays
the contents, but I plan to fix that soon.
